# Description
This is a chatbot application that provides users with deeper, more personalized responses 
based on the capabilities of large language models of data processed by Amazon Bedrock.
This chatbot allows a user to have deeper conversations by usage of internal knowledge 
bases. For example, a user could have a conversation with a chatbot while browsing movies 
to watch, and a chatbot could suggest movies to a user that are relevant to their previous 
genres and high ratings. In the real world, chatbots are able to deliver industrial value by
incorporating information into generation of responses. 

# Caveats and Notices
This chatbot uses a high level of back-end processing power to utilize a knowledge base that
is relevant to the user. In this current project, I have used a folder called *Text_PDFs* to 
hold the data that will be needed for the user to have a conversation with the chatbot that 
concerns Pokemon. It is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series
and films, a trading card game, and other related media.
